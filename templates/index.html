         BART DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY NEW CHAINSAW AND HOCKEY MASK?     Hi Princenipal Skimster. Hi Super Nintendo Chalmers! Homer are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie? They call 'em fingers but I've never seen them fing. Oh there they go. I live in a single room above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley. Marge I won't lie to you. The ring came off my pudding cap! I call the big one bitey! Hahaha dying tickles! I think it was called The Bus that Couldn't Slow Down. You're gonna have to speak up I'm wearing a towel. And Homer if you could kill someone on the way out that would be a huge help. They're the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked! I used to be with it but then they changed what it was. It'll happen to you! Am I too late for the 4:30 autogyro? My eyes! The goggles do nothing! There's something about flying a kite at night that's just so unwholesome. Me fail english? That unpossible! Do you ever wonder why fat people have fat children? Or why chinese people have chinese children?.</div>
